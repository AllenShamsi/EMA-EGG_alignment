# EMA-EGG Signal Alignment

This GitHub repository contains code for aligning Electroglottographic (EGG) and Electromagnetic Articulography (EMA) signals. 
The code aims to synchronize EGG and EMA signals to facilitate further analysis of sub- and supralaryngeal data. The last update to this codebase was on Septemeber 6, 2023.

## Requirements
EMA data: kinematic (.POS) and acoustic (.WAV) signals.
EGG data: laryngographic data in .CSV format with acoustic and kinematic signals.
MATLAB (by MathWorks) is required. 
The procedure explained below assumes the user can access the articulatory data using MVIEW, a MATLAB-based algorithm (Tiede, 2005).
